 Recognition of Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Promoters Using Convolutional Deep Learning Neural Networks
      Ramzan Umarov, Victor Solovyev (PLOS One, 2016).
  Bacterial non-promoter sequences were taken from the corresponding genome sequences: we randomly selected 
fragments of protein-coding genes and took their opposite (non-coding) chain sequences. 
Escherichia coli σ70 promoter sequences were extracted from manually curated RegulonDB [1].
Bacillus subtilis promoters were taken from a collection described in [2].
  As Human, mouse and Arabidopsis non-promoter sequences (size 251 nt) we used random fragments of their genes 
located after first exons.  Eukaryotic promoter sequence regions were extracted from the well-known EPDnew database [3].
  Also additional mouse TATA promoters set was extracted from DBTSS [4].
